# 🐍 Python Programming Roadmap

Welcome to my personal **Python Roadmap**, built to help both **beginners** and **advanced learners** improve their skills step by step.

## ✨ Why This Roadmap?

I created this roadmap to:
- Learn and code every day
- Stay consistent with my learning
- Build projects that are meaningful to me
- Help others follow a structured learning path

## 🔥 Core Principles

- **Code every day** – consistency beats motivation  
- **Take notes** – writing helps you retain better  
- **Prioritize wisely** – know what matters most  
- **One thing at a time** – avoid burnout and distractions  
- **Build projects** – anything! But make it meaningful to you
